        <h6>Bread is a food made from wheat flour and water, fermented with yeast, but some do not use yeast. However, with advances in technology, humans have prepared bread with various ingredients such as salt, oil, butter or eggs to add protein levels to it to obtain a certain texture and taste. Bread is a staple food in many Western and Middle Eastern countries. Bread is the base of pizza and the outer layer of sandwiches. Bread is usually sold in sliced ​​form, and freshly packaged neatly in plastic.
In some cultures, bread is considered so important that it is part of religious rituals. Bread is the oldest processed food in the world. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe shows flour residue on the surfaces of rocks used for pounding food. It is possible that at that time flour had begun to be extracted from tubers, for example from Typha plants and ferns. This flour was spread on a flat stone, baked with fire, to become primitive flatbread.
Around 10,000 BC, with the advent of the Neolithic era and the development of agriculture, grains became the main ingredient in bread. Yeast seeds were not yet known, so the dough rose naturally, without much human intervention.
There are several sources of bread development techniques in the beginning. Yeast in the air can be obtained by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls and Iberians used skimmed beer called barm to make bread that was lighter than what people were used to making. Ancient regions that were more familiar with wine than beer used a paste of grape juice and flour to start fermentation, or wheat grains soaked in wine as a source of yeast. The main source of bread development at that time was the sour bread technique.</h6>

This group of breads is made in the same basic way as bread, but has a high pastry aspect due to its high content of eggs, butter, liquids (milk, water, cream, and sometimes brandy), and sugar. Brios, along with pain au lait and pain aux raisins which are often served at breakfast or snacks form a subgroup of Viennoiserie flower breads. Brios are made with fruit or chocolate chips and served as a pastry or as the base of a dessert with additional ingredients according to local tastes.</p>

        <p>In 500 A.D., Saxons and Vikings living in Britain cultivated rye which was suitable for growing in cold climates. Then black bread finally became popular until the Middle Ages. There are many types of black bread from Finland, Denmark, Russia and the Baltic countries, but the first black bread came from Germany. In Finland, Estonia, Denmark and Russia, black bread is the most widely eaten bread.</p>

        <h1>CROISSANT BREAD</h1>
        <p>According to one legend, croissants were created to celebrate the victory of the Frankish troops over the Umayyad troops in 732. Another popular legend is that this bread was created by a baker when the city of Vienna was besieged by Ottoman Turkish troops who tried to enter through a tunnel, but the tunnel was blown up so that the Turkish troops also lost. To celebrate the victory of Christian forces over the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the baker made bread in the shape of a crescent moon symbolizing Islam and the Ottoman Turkish flag. Another legend says that the French queen from Austria, Marie Antoinette, first brought croissants to France in 1770 because she missed the dish from her country. The validity of these legends is doubtful because they are only stories and myths passed down from generation to generation.</p>

        <h1>FOCACCIA BREAD</h1>
        <p>In Ancient Roman times, panis focacius was plain bread baked in a hearth. The word is taken from the Latin word focus which means hearth, a place for baking. The basic recipe was taught by people of Etruscan origin, but today the bread is associated with Ligurian cuisine.
As the tradition spread, different dialects and a variety of local ingredients produced a large number of breads (some might even be considered cakes). Due to the large number of small towns and hamlets dotting the Ligurian coast, the focaccia recipe has fragmented into countless variations (from the hard-biscuit focaccia in Camogli to the oily soft made in Voltri), with some variants bearing little resemblance with its original form. The most extreme example is a specialty called focaccia col formaggio ("focaccia with cheese") made in Recco, near Genoa.</p>

        <h1>PUMPERNICKEL BREAD</h1>
        <p>The philologist Johann Christoph Adelung (1732–1806) suggested that the word is of colloquial Germanic origin, where pumpern is a New High German synonym for bloat, and Nickel is a form of the name Nicholas, which is generally associated with a goblin or a devil (e.g. Old Nick, common name for Satan), or more commonly for an evil spirit or devil. Therefore, pumpernickel means "devil's fart" or "devil's fart", a definition accepted by the publisher Random House, and by several English dictionaries, including the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. The American Heritage Dictionary adds "so named because it is difficult to digest." A variant of this explanation is also given by the German etymological dictionary Kluge which says the word predates its use for this particular type of bread, and may have been used as a derogatory name for a person with rude manners ("Nick farts") first. The change in meaning may be due to its use as an expression of ridicule towards (in the eyes of outsiders) the raw rye bread produced by the Westphalians</p>

        <h1>SOURDOUGH BREAD</h1>
        <p>In the Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology, Michael Gaenzle writes: "One of the oldest sourdough breads dates to 3700 BC and was excavated in Switzerland, but the origins of sourdough fermentation are likely connected to the origins of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent and Egypt several thousand years earlier", which confirmed several years later by archaeological evidence. [ 3 ] "Bread production has depended on the use of sourdough as a rising agent for most of human history; the use of baker's yeast as a rising agent has been around for less than 150 years."</p>
